This code trains a RandomForestRegressor model to predict shoe offer prices using features like brand, size, and original price. By preprocessing the data with Label Encoding for the 'size' column and splitting it into training and testing sets, the model is effectively trained and evaluated. The evaluation metrics, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2), indicate the model's accuracy and goodness of fit, providing insights into its predictive capabilities for shoe offer prices. This trained model can be used to make predictions on new data for pricing strategies or finding deals.

This conclusion concisely summarizes the code's purpose, highlighting the key steps and the achieved outcome – a trained RandomForestRegressor model ready for predicting shoe offer prices.
